# CSC471LightingProject
This project illustrates the various applications of three different shading techniques: Gouraud, Phong and Silhouette
I did not end up properly executing the silhouette shader after numerous attempts at what I originally thought were viable solutions. 
The Gouraud and Phong shading is, however, done to completion. 

All code that is not mine (provided to me) is properly accredited to the original writer of that code.
